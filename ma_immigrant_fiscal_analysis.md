## Tax Contributions

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts contribute significantly to tax revenues, even though they are barred from most benefits these taxes fund.

### Annual Tax Contributions: ~$1.25 Billion

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| **State & Local Taxes** | **~$650 Million** |
| — Sales & Excise Taxes | ~$280M |
| — Property Taxes | ~$195M |
| — Income Taxes | ~$175M |
| **Federal Taxes** | **~$596 Million** |
| — Social Security | ~$400M |
| — Medicare | ~$100M |
| — Other Federal | ~$96M |

> **Key Point:** Undocumented workers pay into Social Security and Medicare through payroll taxes but are **ineligible to receive benefits**. Nationally, they contribute ~$25.7B to Social Security and ~$6.4B to Medicare annually—essentially subsidizing these programs for citizens.

- Indirect economic effects (e.g., housing market impact)

### Source Perspective Notes

**Cost estimates** primarily from:
- Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)
- Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR)

### Shelter Costs Are Anomalous

The ~$1B shelter cost reflects a **crisis spike since 2021**. Pre-crisis shelter spending was ~$200-250M annually. Massachusetts' unique right-to-shelter law makes it particularly exposed to migrant arrivals. Only NYC has similar legal requirements.
