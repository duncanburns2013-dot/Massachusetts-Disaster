**Version 2.0 - Complete with Non-Citizen Cost Analysis**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Massachusetts faces a fiscal emergency that threatens to transform one of America's wealthiest states into a cautionary tale of government overreach, unsustainable spending, and demographic decline.

### The Numbers That Matter:

| Category | Amount | Your Household Share |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Net Position Deficit | $60.2 Billion | $22,717 |
| Pension Unfunded | $42.1 Billion | $15,876 |
| Bonded Debt | $37.8 Billion | $14,264 |
| OPEB Unfunded | $13.7 Billion | $5,170 |
| MBTA Debt | $5.4 Billion | $2,053 |
| **Non-Citizen Annual Costs** | **$2.9 Billion** | **$1,094** |
| **TOTAL BURDEN** | **$159.1 Billion** | **$60,080** |

**Meanwhile:**
- 86,382 tax filers left in 4 years, taking $12.14 billion in income
- 2.3 million residents (33%) now on MassHealth
- 641,080 non-citizens (9% of population) counted for federal benefits
- $1 billion+ spent annually on emergency shelter
- Only 39% of students meet MCAS standards despite $21.7B in education spending

---

## PART 1: THE NON-CITIZEN COST CRISIS

### The Population Reality

**Massachusetts Non-Citizen Population (2024 Census ACS):**
- Total MA Population: 7,136,171
- Non-Citizens (9.0%): **641,080**
- Estimated Unauthorized: ~275,000
- US-Born Children of Unauthorized: ~118,000
- **Total Affected Population: ~393,000**

### Annual Costs to Taxpayers: $2.9 BILLION

| Category | Cost | Details |
|----------|------|---------|
| Emergency Shelter | $1,000M+ | 50% of shelter population estimated migrants |
| Healthcare (MassHealth) | $800M+ | MassHealth Limited + ER usage |
| Education | $575M+ | ~25,000 unauthorized students + 25,000 US-born children |
| Other Services | $525M+ | Criminal justice, welfare, social services |
| **TOTAL** | **$2.9B** | **$1,094 per MA household** |

### Education Costs Deep Dive

**Source: Center for Immigration Studies, Congressional Budget Office**

- Unauthorized children in MA schools: ~25,000
- US-born children of unauthorized: ~25,000
- **Total affected students: ~50,000**
- MA average cost per pupil: $23,000/year
- Base education cost: $1.15 billion
- ESL premium (20-40% higher for non-English speakers): +$230-460M
- **Total education burden: $1.15-1.4 billion annually**

Key finding: At least 40% of these students arrived since 2021 under federal parole programs.

### Healthcare Costs Analysis

**Sources: CHIA, Kaiser Family Foundation, WBUR**

- Undocumented immigrants eligible for: MassHealth Limited (emergency only)
- Per Kaiser: 40% of undocumented use ER as primary care
- Average ER visit cost: $2,000-3,000
- Births to undocumented mothers: Covered by Emergency Medicaid
- Estimated annual cost: $800M+

Massachusetts is one of only a few states providing state-funded Medicaid to undocumented immigrants.

### The 2026 "Fiscal Time Bomb"

**Warning from Center for Immigration Studies & Mass Fiscal Alliance:**

After 5 years in the United States, immigrants become eligible for additional federal benefits:
- SNAP (food stamps)
- SSI (Supplemental Security Income)
- TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)

Many arrivals from 2021 will become eligible in 2026, creating a potential surge in welfare spending of **hundreds of millions annually**.

### What $2.9 Billion Could Fund Instead

- **Property Tax Relief**: $1,094 per household
- **MBTA Budget**: 100% of annual operating costs
- **Teacher Pay Raises**: $28,400 per teacher
- **Road Repair**: 580 miles of infrastructure

---

## PART 2: THE CENSUS GAME

### Constitutional Framework

The 14th Amendment mandates counting "the whole number of persons in each state" for congressional apportionment. Since 1790, this has included:
- Citizens
- Legal permanent residents
- Visa holders
- Undocumented immigrants
- Anyone present on Census Day

### Massachusetts Congressional Seats

| Census | Seats | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 2000 | 10 | - |
| 2010 | 9 | Lost 1 |
| 2020 | 9 | Held |
| 2030 | 8? | At risk |

**Secretary of State Galvin (WBUR, April 2021):** "Immigrants helped Massachusetts keep its congressional seats"

### Federal Funding Tied to Census: $22.8 BILLION Annually

| Program | Annual Funding |
|---------|---------------|
| MassHealth (Medicaid) | $10.6B |
| Medicare | $8.0B+ |
| SNAP/Food Assistance | $1.5B+ |
| Education (Title I, IDEA) | $500M+ |
| Highway/Transit | $358M+ |
| Housing Assistance | $300M+ |
| **TOTAL** | **$22.8B+** |

### The Political Incentive Structure

**Each person counted = ~$3,300/year in federal funding + fraction of congressional seat**

**Shelter Population Math:**
- People in shelter system: ~20,000
- Census value (20K × $3,300): $66 million/year
- Actual cost to state: $1,000+ million/year
- **NET TAXPAYER LOSS: -$934 million/year**

BUT: They count for congressional representation, state legislative districts, and federal funding formulas.

**The political benefit outweighs the fiscal cost for politicians** - which explains why sanctuary policies persist despite taxpayer losses.

### 2020 Census Accuracy Issues

Census Bureau Post-Enumeration Survey found Massachusetts had a **statistically significant OVERCOUNT**.

Overcounted states (mostly Democratic): Massachusetts, New York, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Delaware

Undercounted states (mostly Republican): Texas, Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi

**Effect:** Blue states retained seats they should have lost; red states missed seats they should have gained.

## PART 3: THE AFFORDABILITY COLLAPSE

### What You Need to Live Comfortably in Massachusetts

**Source: MIT Living Wage Calculator / SmartAsset 2024**

Based on 50/30/20 budget rule (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings):

| Household Type | Income Required |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Single adult (statewide) | $116,022/year |
| Single adult (Boston) | $124,966/year |
| Family of 4 (2 workers, 2 kids) | $301,184/year |

**Massachusetts is ranked #1 most expensive state to live comfortably in America.**

### What Massachusetts Residents Actually Earn

**Source: US Census Bureau ACS 2024**

| Measure | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Median household income | $104,800 |
| Single-person household median | $46,012 |
| Family median income | $128,134 |
| Per capita income | $56,284 |

### Income Distribution

- Under $50,000: **27% of households**
- $50,000-$100,000: 23%
- $100,000-$200,000: 30%
- Over $200,000: 20%

### The Affordability Gap

| Household Type | Needed | Actual | GAP |
|----------------|--------|--------|-----|
| Single adult | $116,022 | $46,012 | **-$70,010** |
| Family of 4 | $301,184 | $128,134 | **-$173,050** |
| Median household | $126,240* | $104,800 | **-$21,440** |

*Basic expenses only (mortgage, healthcare, utilities, food, transportation)

### Home Ownership Requirements

For the average $858,380 home:
- 20% down payment required: $171,676
- Years to save at $2,000/month: 7.2 years
- Monthly PITI payment: $5,800+
- Household income needed (28% DTI): $195,000+

**The typical MA household earns 54% of what's needed to buy the average home.**

### The Result: Dependency Explosion

- MassHealth enrollment: **2.3 million (33% of state)**
- MassHealth growth 2023: +14.8% in one year
- Households under $50K: 27% (in most expensive state)
- Tax filers leaving: 86,382 in 4 years

## PART 6: THE DEPENDENCY SPIRAL

### The Cycle

## PART 8: THE POLITICAL REALITY

### Why Politicians Won't Act

1. **Public employee unions** are major campaign donors
2. **Pension beneficiaries** vote in every election
3. **Federal funding** rewards population count, not citizen count
4. **Sanctuary policies** popular with activist base
5. **No immediate consequences** - debt paid by future taxpayers

### What Voters Must Demand

1. **Transparency**: Publish citizen vs. non-citizen population estimates
2. **Accountability**: Annual performance audits with consequences
3. **Reform**: Pension, shelter, healthcare eligibility changes
4. **Competition**: End public sector monopolies
5. **Limits**: Constitutional spending caps

---

## CONCLUSION: TWO FUTURES

### Path A: Current Trajectory (2030)

- Net deficit: $80+ billion
- Per household debt: $55,000+
- More tax increases inevitable
- Continued exodus (250,000+ more leave)
- Services decline despite higher spending
- Housing: $1.1M+ average
- Detroit-style decline

### Path B: Reform (2030)

- Debt stabilized then reduced
- Per household debt: $35,000 (declining)
- No new taxes needed
- Net-zero migration by 2027
- Services improve with same money
- Housing growth at inflation
- Competitive, growing state

**The choice is yours. The math is undeniable. The time is now.**
