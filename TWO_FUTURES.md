# TWO FUTURES FOR MASSACHUSETTS
## Current Path vs. Reform Path: A Side-by-Side Comparison

📊 **See: `charts/two_futures.svg`**

---

# THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE

Politicians love to say "What's your solution?" while doing nothing. Here are the solutions. Here's what happens if we implement them. Here's what happens if we don't.

**No more excuses.**

---

# SCENARIO 1: CURRENT PATH ("Stay the Course")

## What "Stay the Course" Actually Means

When politicians say "we're working on it" or "we need to study this further," they mean: **do nothing and hope voters don't notice.**

Here's where that leads by 2030:

---

### 💸 DEBT: From Bad to Catastrophic

| Metric | 2024 (Now) | 2030 (Projected) | Change |
|--------|------------|------------------|--------|
| Net Deficit | $60.2B | $80-85B | +$20-25B |
| Pension Unfunded | $42.1B | $55-60B | +$13-18B |
| OPEB Unfunded | $15.8B | $20B+ | +$5B+ |
| **Per Household Debt** | **$40,599** | **$55,000+** | **+$15,000** |

**Why it gets worse:**
- Pension contributions growing 5-7% annually
- OPEB virtually unfunded (pay-as-you-go)
- New borrowing for "deferred maintenance"
- No structural reforms = compounding problem

---

### 📈 TAXES: Increases Are Inevitable

**Already Passed:**
- Millionaire surtax: 4% on income over $1M (2023)
- Projected revenue: $1.8B/year

**Coming Next (Without Reform):**
- Sales tax increase (6.25% → 7% or higher)
- Income tax increase (5% → 6%?)
- Property tax override votes (already happening)
- New "fees" (registration, licensing, tolls)
- Carbon tax / gas tax increases

**The Math:**
- $3.5B annual shortfall growing
- Federal COVID aid: Gone
- Pension bills: Coming due
- Shelter costs: Open-ended liability

**Someone has to pay.** Without spending reform, it's YOU.

### 🚗 MIGRATION: The Death Spiral

| Period | Net Loss (People) | Net Loss (AGI) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2018-2022 | 153,080 | $12.2 Billion |
| 2023-2027 (projected) | 200,000+ | $18B+ |
| 2028-2032 (projected) | 250,000+ | $25B+ |

**The Death Spiral:**
1. High taxes drive out high earners
2. Fewer taxpayers = higher burden on those remaining
3. Higher burden = more people leave
4. Repeat until collapse

**Who's Leaving:**
- Average income of leavers: $126,376
- Average income of arrivals: $119,416
- **We're losing our highest earners**

**Where They're Going:**
- Florida: No income tax, no estate tax
- New Hampshire: No income tax, no sales tax
- Texas: No income tax, growing economy
- North Carolina: Lower taxes, lower cost of living

---

### 📉 SERVICES: Paying More, Getting Less

**Education:**
| Metric | 2019 | 2024 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Spending | $19.2B | $21.7B | +13% |
| MCAS Passing | 52% | 39% | **-13 pts** |

By 2030 at current trajectory: **$25B+ spending, 30% passing?**

**MBTA:**
- $9.25B in obligations
- Slow zones everywhere
- Safety violations mounting
- $122M overtime (13.9% of payroll)
- Service: Getting worse

**Healthcare:**
- $78.1B total spending
- Growing 8.6%/year (target: 3.6%)
- MassHealth: 2.3M enrolled (1/3 of state!)
- Per capita: Among highest in nation

**The Pattern:** More money in, worse results out. That's not bad luck. That's **structural failure.**

---

### 🏠 HOUSING: Priced Out of Your Own State

| Year | Avg Home Price | Income Needed |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| 2021 | $664K | $155K |
| 2024 | $858K | $195K |
| 2030 (proj) | $1.1M+ | $250K+ |

**What This Means:**
- Young families can't buy homes
- They leave for affordable states
- Population ages and declines
- Tax base shrinks further

**Current inventory: 1.66 months** (healthy market = 6 months)

---

### 🏨 SHELTER: Unlimited Liability

| Period | Annual Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| Pre-2023 | $324M |
| 2024 | $1B+ |
| 2030 (no reform) | $1.5B+? |

**Massachusetts is the ONLY state with a right-to-shelter law.**

This creates:
- Unlimited liability
- Magnet effect for migrants
- $10,000+/month per family
- No end in sight

---

### 🔮 2030 Under Current Path

- **Debt per household:** $55,000+
- **Property tax (avg):** $14,000+
- **Income tax:** Likely increased
- **Population:** Declining
- **Services:** Deteriorating
- **Young families:** Gone to NH, FL, TX

**This is the Detroit model.** High taxes, bad services, population collapse, more taxes, more collapse.

---

# SCENARIO 2: REFORM PATH

## What Reform Actually Looks Like

These aren't theoretical. Other states do this. It works.

---

### 💰 DEBT: Stabilize Then Reduce

**Immediate Actions:**
- Hybrid pension for new hires (saves $500M+/year long-term)
- End pension spiking (overtime excluded from calculations)
- OPEB pre-funding requirement

**5-Year Target:**
| Metric | 2024 | 2030 (Reformed) |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Net Deficit | $60.2B | $55-58B (reduced!) |
| Pension Growth | +5-7%/yr | +2-3%/yr |
| Per Household | $40,599 | $35,000 |

**How:**
- Stop adding to the problem (pension reform)
- Structural savings fund debt reduction
- No new borrowing without offsetting cuts

---

### 📉 TAXES: No Increases Needed

**$3.5 Billion in Savings = No New Taxes**

| Reform | Annual Savings |
|--------|----------------|
| Shelter reform | $700M |
| MassHealth reform | $800M |
| Pension reform | $500M |
| Education consolidation | $400M |
| Procurement reform | $300M |
| Overtime caps | $200M |
| Workforce right-sizing | $200M |
| MBTA efficiency | $150M |
| **TOTAL** | **$3.25-4.0B** |

**What This Means:**
- No income tax increase needed
- No sales tax increase needed
- Potential property tax relief
- Competitive with low-tax states

---

### 🏠 MIGRATION: Reverse the Flow

**Goal: Net-Zero Migration by 2027**

**How:**
- Tax competitiveness (no increases)
- Business-friendly environment
- Housing affordability (zoning reform)
- Quality of life improvements

**The Virtuous Cycle:**
1. Stable/lower taxes retain residents
2. More taxpayers = lower burden per person
3. Lower burden = attract new residents
4. Growing tax base = better services without higher rates

**Target:**
| Period | Net Migration |
|--------|---------------|
| 2018-2022 | -153,080 |
| 2025-2027 | -50,000 (slowing) |
| 2028-2030 | Net positive |

---

### 📈 SERVICES: Better Results, Same Money

**Education Reform:**
- Consolidate 396 districts → 200
- Cut administration from 15% to 10% of budgets
- Performance-based accountability
- School choice expansion

**Target:** 50% MCAS passing by 2030 (vs. 39% today) with FLAT spending

**MBTA Reform:**
- Overtime cap at 8% (currently 13.9%)
- Competitive bidding for all contracts
- Performance-based management
- Pension reform for new hires

**Target:** On-time performance up 20%, costs flat

**Healthcare Reform:**
- MassHealth eligibility verification annually
- Work requirements for able-bodied adults
- Pharmacy benefit reform
- Fraud audits

**Target:** $22.2B → $20B (save $2B+), same or better outcomes

---

### 🏗️ HOUSING: Actually Build

**Zoning Reform:**
- Override local restrictions for multi-family
- By-right development near transit
- Streamlined permitting (90-day max)

**Result:**
- More housing supply = lower prices
- 6-month inventory (healthy market)
- Young families can afford to stay
- Population stabilizes

**Target:** Price growth at inflation (2-3%) vs. current 7%+

---

### 🎯 SHELTER: Sustainable and Humane

**Reforms:**
- Right-to-shelter limited to MA residents (1+ year)
- 9-month limit strictly enforced
- Work requirements for able-bodied
- Federal coordination on immigration

**Cost:**
| Scenario | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| Current | $1B+ |
| Reformed | $300M |
| **Savings** | **$700M+** |

**This is not cruel.** Every other state operates this way. MA is the outlier.

---

### 🔮 2030 Under Reform Path

- **Debt per household:** $35,000 (down from $40,599)
- **Property tax (avg):** $10,500 (stable)
- **Income tax:** No increase
- **Population:** Stable/growing
- **Services:** Improving
- **Young families:** Can afford to stay

**This is the Florida/Texas model.** Efficient government, competitive taxes, growing population, improving services.

---

# THE POLITICAL REALITY

## Why Politicians Won't Act

1. **Union donations** - Public employee unions fund campaigns
2. **Contractor donations** - Beneficiaries of waste donate
3. **Advocacy group pressure** - Loud voices for spending
4. **Media bias** - "Cuts" are always framed negatively
5. **Short-term thinking** - Next election > next generation

## What They'll Say

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "We need more study" | We have the data. Act. |
| "It's complicated" | Other states figured it out |
| "We can't cut services" | We're cutting waste, not services |
| "The rich should pay more" | They're leaving. Who's next? |
| "Federal government should help" | They won't. Fix it ourselves. |
| "It's not that bad" | $60.2B deficit. 39% MCAS. 153K gone. |

## How to Force Action

1. **Vote** - Primary every big spender
2. **Speak** - Town halls, public comment, letters
3. **Organize** - Taxpayer groups, parent groups
4. **Donate** - Support reform candidates
5. **Run** - Be the change
6. **Leave** - The ultimate vote (and they notice)

---

# THE BOTTOM LINE

## Current Path
- **By 2030:** $55K debt per household, higher taxes, declining population, worse services
- **End state:** Detroit

## Reform Path  
- **By 2030:** $35K debt per household, no tax increases, stable population, better services
- **End state:** Competitive, functional state

## The Difference
- **$20,000 per household** in debt
- **$1,500/year per household** in savings
- **The future of Massachusetts**
