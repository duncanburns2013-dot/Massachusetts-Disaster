# THE REAL MASSACHUSETTS CRISIS
## Census Games, Affordability Collapse, and the Taxpayer Squeeze

📊 **Data Sources: Commonwealth ACFRs, IRS SOI, US Census Bureau, CHIA, MIT Living Wage Calculator**

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Massachusetts is caught in a vicious cycle that benefits politicians at the expense of citizens:

1. **Productive residents leave** → Taking $12.1 billion in income (2018-2022)
2. **Non-citizens are counted in census** → Preserving congressional seats and $22.8B in federal funding
3. **Cost of living exceeds income** → 1/3 of state population on government healthcare
4. **Taxpayers fund the difference** → Through debt, taxes, and declining services

**This is not accidental. It's structural.**

# PART 1: THE CENSUS GAME

## How Congressional Representation Actually Works

The 14th Amendment mandates counting "the whole number of persons in each state" for congressional apportionment. This includes:

- ✅ Citizens
- ✅ Legal permanent residents
- ✅ Visa holders
- ✅ Undocumented immigrants
- ✅ Anyone present on Census Day

**The result:** States can gain or keep congressional seats by having large non-citizen populations, regardless of how many actual voters live there.

## Massachusetts and the Census

| Census Year | Congressional Seats | Change |
|-------------|--------------------:|-------:|
| 2000 | 10 | — |
| 2010 | 9 | **-1** |
| 2020 | 9 | 0 |
| 2030 | ? | At risk |

### What Secretary of State Galvin Said (2021):
> "Galvin credited immigrants with helping Massachusetts keep its congressional seats"
> — WBUR News, April 26, 2021

### The 2020 Census showed Massachusetts was OVERCOUNTED
The Census Bureau's Post-Enumeration Survey found Massachusetts had a **statistically significant overcount** — meaning more people were counted than actually lived here.

States that were **overcounted** (mostly Democratic):
- Massachusetts, New York, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Delaware, Ohio, Utah

States that were **undercounted** (mostly Republican):
- Texas, Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Illinois

**Effect:** Blue states retained seats they should have lost; red states missed seats they should have gained.

## The Federal Funding Connection

Census counts drive **$22.8+ BILLION annually** in federal funds to Massachusetts, including:

| Program | Annual Amount | Census-Tied |
|---------|-------------:|:-----------:|
| MassHealth (Medicaid) | $10.6B | ✅ |
| Medicare | $8B+ | ✅ |
| Highway/Transit | $358M+ | ✅ |
| Education (Title I, IDEA) | $500M+ | ✅ |
| Housing assistance | $300M+ | ✅ |
| SNAP/Food assistance | $1.5B+ | ✅ |
| **TOTAL** | **$22.8B+** | — |

### The Incentive Structure

Politicians have a **direct financial incentive** to:
1. Maximize population count regardless of citizenship
2. Attract migrants to offset departing citizens
3. Resist federal immigration enforcement
4. Maintain "sanctuary" policies

**Each person counted = approximately $3,300/year in federal funds**

For the estimated 20,000+ people in emergency shelter system:
- **Census value:** $66+ million/year in federal funding
- **Cost to state:** $1+ billion/year in shelter expenses

**Net cost to Massachusetts taxpayers: ~$930+ million/year**

# PART 2: THE AFFORDABILITY COLLAPSE

## Income vs. Cost of Living: The Gap

### What You Need to Live "Comfortably" in Massachusetts (2024)

| Household Type | Required Income | Median Income | GAP |
|---------------|----------------:|-------------:|----:|
| Single adult | $116,022 | $46,012* | **-$70,010** |
| Single adult (Boston) | $124,966 | — | — |
| Family of 4 (2 workers, 2 kids) | $301,184 | $128,134** | **-$173,050** |

*Single-person household median
**Family median income

### Massachusetts is the #1 Most Expensive State to Live Comfortably
According to SmartAsset (2024), Massachusetts requires the highest income in the nation for a single adult to cover needs (50%), wants (30%), and savings (20%).

### The Math Doesn't Work

**Median Household Income:** $104,800

**Annual Expenses for Median Home Ownership:**

| Expense | Monthly | Annual |
|---------|--------:|-------:|
| Mortgage (PITI) on $858K home | $5,800 | $69,600 |
| Healthcare (per capita x 2.5) | $2,320 | $27,840 |
| Utilities | $400 | $4,800 |
| Food (family) | $1,200 | $14,400 |
| Transportation | $800 | $9,600 |
| **TOTAL BASICS** | **$10,520** | **$126,240** |

**$104,800 income - $126,240 expenses = -$21,440 SHORTFALL**

This doesn't include:
- Childcare ($15,000-$25,000/year)
- Student loans
- Retirement savings
- Any discretionary spending

## The Dependency Explosion

### MassHealth (Medicaid) Enrollment: 2.3 MILLION

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Total enrollment | 2,300,000 |
| % of state population | **33%** |
| Growth (2023) | +14.8% |
| Cost | $22.2 Billion |
| Cost per enrollee | $9,652/year |

**One in three Massachusetts residents is on government healthcare.**

### Income Distribution (2023 Census)

| Income Level | % of Households |
|--------------|----------------:|
| Under $50,000 | **27%** |
| $50,000-$100,000 | 23% |
| $100,000-$200,000 | 30% |
| Over $200,000 | 20% |

**More than 1 in 4 households earns under $50,000** in the most expensive state in the country.

### The Working Poor Trap

A family earning $60,000 in Massachusetts:
- Makes too much for most benefits
- Makes too little to afford basics
- Is one emergency from crisis
- Cannot save for a home ($171,676 down payment needed)

# PART 3: THE EXODUS — VERIFIED DATA

## IRS Statistics of Income: 4-Year Migration (2018-2022)

### Year-by-Year Net Loss (Tax Returns)

| Tax Year | Net Returns Lost | Net AGI Lost | Acceleration |
|----------|----------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| 2018-2019 | 14,925 | $1.45B | — |
| 2019-2020 | 20,395 | $2.55B | +37% |

### Income Comparison: Who's Leaving vs. Who's Arriving

| Metric | Leaving MA | Arriving in MA | Difference |
|--------|----------:|---------------:|----------:|
| Total Returns (4-yr) | 381,521 | 295,139 | -86,382 |
| Total AGI (4-yr) | $41.93B | $29.79B | -$12.14B |
| **Average AGI** | **$109,902** | **$100,920** | **+$8,983** |

**People leaving Massachusetts earn nearly $9,000 MORE per year on average than people arriving.**

### Where They're Going (2021-2022)

| Destination | Net People Lost | Net AGI Lost |
|-------------|----------------:|-------------:|
| Florida | 13,106 | $1.45B |
| New Hampshire | 9,542 | $502M |
| Texas | 3,627 | $170M |
| North Carolina | 3,256 | $130M |
| South Carolina | 2,518 | $104M |

### The Tax Comparison

| State | Income Tax | Sales Tax | Property Tax (median home) |
|-------|----------:|----------:|---------------------------:|
| **Massachusetts** | **5% + 4% surtax** | **6.25%** | **$10,585** |
| Florida | 0% | 6% | ~$4,500 |

# PART 4: THE REPLACEMENT STRATEGY

## Citizens Out, Non-Citizens In

### The Mathematical Reality

| Population Change | Number | Census Impact |
|-------------------|-------:|--------------:|
| Citizens leaving (4 yrs) | ~150,000+ | -150,000 |
| Non-citizens arriving | ? | +? |
| Net census count | Stable | = Keep seats |

### Emergency Shelter Population

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Current families in shelter | ~5,600 |
| Estimated individuals | ~20,000+ |
| % from outside MA (pre-crisis) | Low |
| % migrants (current estimate) | ~50% |
| Cost per family/month | $10,000-$13,000 |
| Annual cost | $1+ Billion |

### The Political Calculus

**If 20,000 shelter residents are counted in Census:**
- Federal funding value: ~$66 million/year
- Cost to state: $1+ billion/year
- Net taxpayer loss: **~$934 million/year**

**But:**
- They count for congressional apportionment
- They count for state legislative districts
- They count for federal funding formulas

**Political benefit outweighs fiscal cost — if you're a politician.**

# PART 7: SOLUTIONS — WITHOUT IMPOVERISHING TAXPAYERS

## The Core Principle

**Stop replacing taxpayers with tax consumers.**

Every policy should be evaluated by one question:
> "Does this help retain productive citizens or drive them away?"

---

## SOLUTION SET 1: Census/Representation Reform

### Federal Level (Advocate For)
1. **Support citizenship question on 2030 Census**
   - House passed Equal Representation Act (H.R. 7109)
   - Requires citizenship data for apportionment
   
2. **Support citizens-only apportionment**
   - Constitutional amendment pending
   - Would allocate seats based on citizen population

### State Level (Implement Now)
1. **End sanctuary policies**
   - Cooperate with federal immigration enforcement
   - Reduces magnet effect
   
2. **Verify residency for state benefits**
   - Require documented 1+ year residency
   - Prevents benefit tourism

3. **Transparent census preparation**
   - Publish estimates of citizen vs. non-citizen population
   - Let voters see the trade-offs

---

## SOLUTION SET 2: Affordability Crisis

### Housing (Increase Supply)
1. **Override local zoning restrictions**
   - Allow multi-family by-right near transit
   - 90-day maximum permit timeline
   - Reduce per-unit costs
   
2. **Property tax circuit breaker expansion**
   - Cap property tax at % of income for residents
   - Prevent tax-driven displacement

### Healthcare (Reduce Costs)
1. **MassHealth eligibility verification**
   - Annual verification required
   - Data matching with IRS, SSA
   - Remove ineligible enrollees
   - **Est. savings: $800M+/year**

2. **Work requirements**
   - Able-bodied adults without dependents
   - 20 hours/week work, training, or service
   - Exemptions for disability, caregiving

### Tax Competitiveness
1. **No new taxes**
   - $3.5B in spending reforms first
   - Make existing revenue work

2. **Repeal millionaire surtax** (long-term)
   - Driving out highest earners
   - Counterproductive to revenue goals

---

## SOLUTION SET 3: End the Shelter Crisis

### Immediate Actions
1. **Limit right-to-shelter to MA residents**
   - Require 1+ year documented residency
   - Other states don't have this mandate
   - **Savings: $500M+/year**

2. **Enforce 9-month time limits strictly**
   - No indefinite extensions
   - Exit planning from day one

3. **Work requirements**
   - Accept available employment within 90 days
   - Refusal = loss of shelter benefits

4. **Federal coordination**
   - Cooperate on cases involving criminal activity
   - Advocate for border enforcement
   - Seek maximum federal reimbursement

### Target: Return to Pre-Crisis Levels
| Metric | Pre-Crisis | Current | Target |
|--------|----------:|--------:|-------:|
| Monthly cost | $27M | $75M+ | $30M |
| Annual cost | $324M | $1B+ | $360M |
| Families | 4,100 | 5,600 | 4,000 |
| **Savings** | — | — | **$640M+** |

---

## SOLUTION SET 4: Government Efficiency

### Pension Reform
- Hybrid plan for all new hires (50% DB / 50% DC)
- End pension spiking (exclude OT from calculations)
- Raise retirement age to 62
- **Long-term savings: Tens of billions**

### Overtime Crackdown
- Cap at 10% of departmental payroll
- Suffolk Sheriff at 27.4% — immediate audit
- **Savings: $200M+/year**

### Education Consolidation
- Merge districts under 1,000 students
- Shared back-office services
- Cap administration at 10% of budget
- **Savings: $400M+/year**

### Procurement Reform
- Minimum 3 competitive bids
- End no-bid contract abuse
- Public contract database
- **Savings: $300M+/year**

---

## TOTAL SAVINGS POTENTIAL

| Reform | Annual Savings |
|--------|---------------:|
| MassHealth verification | $800M |
| Shelter reform | $640M |
| Pension reform | $500M |
| Education consolidation | $400M |
| Procurement reform | $300M |
| Overtime caps | $200M |
| Workforce right-sizing | $200M |
| MBTA efficiency | $150M |
| **TOTAL** | **$3.19B+** |

### Per Household Impact

| Scenario | Per Household Savings |
|----------|---------------------:|
| Low estimate ($3.0B) | $1,132/year |
| Mid estimate ($3.5B) | $1,321/year |
| High estimate ($4.0B) | $1,509/year |

# PART 8: THE POLITICAL REALITY

## Why Politicians Won't Act

1. **Census/Federal Funding**
   - More people = more federal dollars
   - Doesn't matter if they're citizens
   - Doesn't matter if state cost exceeds federal benefit

2. **Union Influence**
   - Public employee unions oppose pension/workforce reform
   - Major campaign donors
   - Organized opposition to any cuts

3. **Advocacy Groups**
   - "Cuts" framed as attacks on vulnerable
   - Media amplifies opposition
   - Politicians fear bad press

4. **Short-Term Thinking**
   - Next election matters more than next generation
   - Kick the can down the road
   - Let the next governor deal with it

## What Voters Must Do

1. **Demand answers on census strategy**
   - Ask: "Do you support counting only citizens for apportionment?"
   - Ask: "What's the cost/benefit of shelter policy?"

2. **Vote on fiscal responsibility**
   - Primary big spenders
   - Support reform candidates regardless of party

3. **Organize taxpayer coalitions**
   - Outnumber special interests
   - Show up at hearings
   - Contact legislators constantly

4. **Consider leaving**
   - The ultimate vote
   - 86,382 tax filers did in 4 years
   - Politicians notice population loss

---

# CONCLUSION: THE CHOICE

## Path A: Current Trajectory

By 2030:
- Debt per household: $55,000+
- More tax increases
- More productive people leave
- Services continue to decline
- Dependency continues to grow
- Detroit-style collapse

## Path B: Reform

By 2030:
- Debt per household: $35,000 (stabilized)
- No tax increases needed
- Population stabilizes
- Services improve
- Dependency reduced
- Competitive, functional state

## FINAL THOUGHT

> "While people continue to flee Democrat-run cities, desperate Democrats have back-filled the mass exodus with illegal immigrants so that they do not lose their seats in Congress or their electoral votes, hence artificially boosting their political power and in turn diluting the power of other Americans' votes."
> — Senator Bill Hagerty (TN), June 2025

Whether you agree with the politics or not, the math is undeniable:

**Massachusetts is trading productive citizens for dependent non-citizens, and taxpayers are funding the exchange.**

This is not sustainable. Something will break.

**The only question is: Will it be reform, or collapse?**
