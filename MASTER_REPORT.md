## TOTAL POTENTIAL SAVINGS

| Reform Area | Annual Savings |
|-------------|----------------|
| Shelter Crisis | $700M+ |
| MassHealth Reform | $800M+ |
| Pension Reform | $500M+ |
| Education Consolidation | $400M+ |

### What This Means for You

**Per Household Savings: $1,200 - $1,500 per year**

These are not theoretical savings. Other states have implemented similar reforms:
- **Florida** has no income tax and a balanced budget
- **Texas** has no income tax and growing population
- **New Hampshire** has no income or sales tax

Massachusetts can learn from states that are GAINING residents instead of losing them.

# TRANSPARENCY MEASURES

Beyond savings, Massachusetts needs sunlight:

1. **Real-time spending dashboard** for all state expenditures
2. **Public employee salary database** including all overtime
3. **Pension calculator** showing individual liabilities
4. **Campaign finance reform** banning meals, entertainment, travel
5. **Lobbyist disclosure** with same-day online posting
6. **Contract database** with all bids and awards public
7. **Budget comparison** actual vs. projected in understandable format

---

# CALL TO ACTION

This crisis will not fix itself. Voters must demand:

1. **Vote for fiscal conservatives** regardless of party
2. **Attend town meetings** and ask about unfunded liabilities
3. **Contact legislators** with specific reform demands
4. **Share this report** with neighbors and on social media
5. **Run for office** if current officials won't act

**The people leaving Massachusetts aren't stupid.** They're voting with their feet. If we don't fix these problems, more will follow — leaving fewer taxpayers to shoulder an ever-growing burden.
